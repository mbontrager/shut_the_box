# Shut the Box

What's the probability of shutting the box? 

"Shut the Box" is a dice game where the player rolls 2 die and flips over numbers from 1 to 12 that sum to the total value of the roll of the two die. The player's final score is the total of all the numbers left unflipped when it's no longer possible to close anything else. 

I'm curious to know what the probability is of closing all numbers in the box.
